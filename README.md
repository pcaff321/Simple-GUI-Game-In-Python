# Simple-GUI-Game-In-Python
Simple GUI Game in Python as an introduction to using GUI elements using the Tkinter module and using them to make a functional game in Python.

# Gameplay

1. A 'streak' is recorded if you press the figure within 2 seconds, and this streak will increase until you fail to click within 2 minutes. If you click after 2 seconds, your streak will reset to 0. 
2. As your streak continues, the figure becomes smaller*. This increases the difficulty of the game. As your streak gets longer, the figure will change colour. Each colour represents extra points earned. The scoring is as follows: Blue Square - 1 point Red Square - 2 points Gold Square - 3 points DIAMOND - 5 points <- Highest bonus *The figure has a limit to how small it will get, so it doesn't get too small to click, or invisible. 
3. If you lose your streak, the figure will reset back to a blue square. 
4. Your highest streak is also recorded in the game, and will not reset if you lose your current streak.
